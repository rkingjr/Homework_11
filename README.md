# Homework 11: Note Taker

**Version 1.0**
## Description:

With this application, the user should be able to enter a note, save it to memory, then delete it at a later time.

Unfortunately, this application, as seen in the below Screencastify, only goes from the home page to the notes page but does not save or delete the note.
